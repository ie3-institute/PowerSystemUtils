/**
 * This class represents a Quantity with the value null. So i.e. instead of "{@code Quantity<Length>
 * length = null;}" you should use "{@code Quantity<Length> length =
 * EmptyQuantity.of(Units.METRE);}" <br>
 * Any arithmetic operations you perform on this class will throw a EmptyQuantityException as you're
 * not intended to do so. The reason to have this quantity instead of using null directly is to
 * provide a more obvious way to deal with empty quantities instead of just using null for an empty
 * quantity.
 *
 * <p>Possible application cases are e.g. time series consisting of several quantities based on real
 * data. As real time series sometimes might lack some values, it is preferred to indicate that that
 * these values are missing in the input data by providing an instance of {@link EmptyQuantity}
 * instead of using null. This is motivated by making the missing value explicit, instead of
 * implicitly assuming that null represents a missing value.
